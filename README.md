## 🚀 Installation

### One-Line Bootstrap (Recommended ⭐)
```bash
wget https://github.com/3rr0r-505/HawkPro/raw/main/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo bash installer.sh
````

### 🐳 Docker Usage
```bash
docker build --no-cache -t hawkpro .
docker run -it --rm --pid=host --net=host -v /proc:/proc hawkpro
```
`⚠️ Docker Note:`
When running inside Docker, HawkPro may detect containerized system information instead of the physical host due to Linux namespace isolation.
For best accuracy and performance → run natively on Linux.

### 🛠 Build From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/3rr0r-505/HawkPro.git
cd HawkPro

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

./hawkpro
```
